      <h2>Book One</h2>
<h3>1 <a id="section-1"></a></h3>
<p>The tao that can be told<br />
is not the eternal Tao<br />
The name that can be named<br />
is not the eternal Name.<br />
The unnamable is the eternally real.<br />
Naming is the origin of all material things.<br />
Free from desire, you realize the mystery.<br />
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.<br />
Yet mystery and manifestations<br />
arise from the same source.<br />
This source is called darkness.<br />
Darkness within darkness.<br />
The gateway to all understanding.</p>
<h3>2 <a id="section-2"></a></h3>
<p>When people see some things as beautiful,<br />
other things become ugly.<br />
When people see some things as good,<br />
other things become bad.<br />
Being and non-being create each other.<br />
Difficult and easy support each other.<br />
Long and short define each other.<br />
High and low depend on each other.<br />
Before and after follow each other.<br />
Therefore the Master<br />
acts without doing anything<br />
and teaches without saying anything.<br />
Things arise and she lets them come;<br />
things disappear and she lets them go.<br />
She has but doesn’t possess,<br />
acts but doesn’t expect.<br />
When her work is done, she forgets it.<br />
That is why it lasts forever.</p>
<h3>3 <a id="section-3"></a></h3>
<p>If you overesteem great men,<br />
people become powerless.<br />
If you overvalue possessions,<br />
people begin to steal.<br />
The Master leads<br />
by emptying people’s minds<br />
and filling their cores,<br />
by weakening their ambition<br />
and toughening their resolve.<br />
He helps people lose everything they know,<br />
everything they desire,<br />
and creates confusion<br />
in those who think that they know.<br />
Practice not-doing,<br />
and everything will fall into place.</p>
<h3>4 <a id="section-4"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao is like a well:<br />
used but never used up.<br />
It is like the eternal void:<br />
filled with infinite possibilities.<br />
It is hidden but always present.<br />
I don’t know who gave birth to it.<br />
It is older than God.</p>
<h3>5 <a id="section-5"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao doesn’t take sides;<br />
it gives birth to both good and evil.<br />
The Master doesn’t take sides;<br />
she welcomes both saints and sinners.<br />
The Tao is like a bellows:<br />
it is empty yet infinitely capable.<br />
The more you use it, the more it produces;<br />
the more you talk of it, the less you understand.<br />
Hold on to the center.</p>
<h3>6 <a id="section-6"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao is called the Great Mother:<br />
empty yet inexhaustible,<br />
it gives birth to infinite worlds.<br />
It is always present within you.<br />
You can use it any way you want.<br /></p>
<h3>7 <a id="section-7"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao is infinite, eternal.<br />
Why is it eternal?<br />
It was never born;<br />
thus it can never die.<br />
Why is it infinite?<br />
It has no desires for itself;<br />
thus it is present for all beings.<br />
The Master stays behind;<br />
that is why she is ahead.<br />
She is detached from all things;<br />
that is why she is one with them.<br />
Because she has let go of herself,<br />
she is perfectly fulfilled.</p>
<h3>8 <a id="section-8"></a></h3>
<p>The supreme good is like water,<br />
which nourishes all things without trying to.<br />
It is content with the low places that people disdain.<br />
Thus it is like the Tao.<br />
In dwelling, live close to the ground.<br />
In thinking, keep to the simple.<br />
In conflict, be fair and generous.<br />
In governing, don’t try to control.<br />
In work, do what you enjoy.<br />
In family life, be completely present.<br />
When you are content to be simply yourself<br />
and don’t compare or compete,<br />
everybody will respect you.</p>
<h3>9 <a id="section-9"></a></h3>
<p>Fill your bowl to the brim<br />
and it will spill.<br />
Keep sharpening your knife<br />
and it will blunt.<br />
Chase after money and security<br />
and your heart will never unclench.<br />
Care about people’s approval<br />
and you will be their prisoner.<br />
Do your work, then step back.<br />
The only path to serenity.</p>
<h3>10 <a id="section-10"></a></h3>
<p>Can you coax your mind from its wandering<br />
and keep to the original oneness?<br />
Can you let your body become<br />
supple as a newborn child’s?<br />
Can you cleanse your inner vision<br />
until you see nothing but the light?<br />
Can you love people and lead them<br />
without imposing your will?<br />
Can you deal with the most vital matters<br />
by letting events take their course?<br />
Can you step back from you own mind<br />
and thus understand all things?<br />
Giving birth and nourishing,<br />
having without possessing,<br />
acting with no expectations,<br />
leading and not trying to control:<br />
this is the supreme virtue.</p>
<h3>11 <a id="section-11"></a></h3>
<p>We join spokes together in a wheel,<br />
but it is the center hole<br />
that makes the wagon move.<br />
We shape clay into a pot,<br />
but it is the emptiness inside<br />
that holds whatever we want.<br />
We hammer wood for a house,<br />
but it is the inner space<br />
that makes it livable.<br />
We work with being,<br />
but non-being is what we use.</p>
<h3>12 <a id="section-12"></a></h3>
<p>Colors blind the eye.<br />
Sounds deafen the ear.<br />
Flavors numb the taste.<br />
Thoughts weaken the mind.<br />
Desires wither the heart.<br />
The Master observes the world<br />
but trusts his inner vision.<br />
He allows things to come and go.<br />
His heart is open as the sky.</p>
<h3>13 <a id="section-13"></a></h3>
<p>Success is as dangerous as failure.<br />
Hope is as hollow as fear.<br />
What does it mean that success is as dangerous as failure?<br />
Whether you go up the ladder or down it,<br />
your position is shaky.<br />
When you stand with your two feet on the ground,<br />
you will always keep your balance.<br />
What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?<br />
Hope and fear are both phantoms<br />
that arise from thinking of the self.<br />
When we don’t see the self as self,<br />
what do we have to fear?<br />
See the world as your self.<br />
Have faith in the way things are.<br />
Love the world as your self;<br />
then you can care for all things.</p>
<h3>14 <a id="section-14"></a></h3>
<p>Look, and it can’t be seen.<br />
Listen, and it can’t be heard.<br />
Reach, and it can’t be grasped.<br />
Above, it isn’t bright.<br />
Below, it isn’t dark.<br />
Seamless, unnamable,<br />
it returns to the realm of nothing.<br />
Form that includes all forms,<br />
image without an image,<br />
subtle, beyond all conception.<br />
Approach it and there is no beginning;<br />
follow it and there is no end.<br />
You can’t know it, but you can be it,<br />
at ease in your own life.<br />
Just realize where you come from:<br />
this is the essence of wisdom.</p>
<h3>15 <a id="section-15"></a></h3>
<p>The ancient Masters were profound and subtle.<br />
Their wisdom was unfathomable.<br />
There is no way to describe it;<br />
all we can describe is their appearance.<br />
They were careful<br />
as someone crossing an iced-over stream.<br />
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.<br />
Courteous as a guest.<br />
Fluid as melting ice.<br />
Shapable as a block of wood.<br />
Receptive as a valley.<br />
Clear as a glass of water.<br />
Do you have the patience to wait<br />
till your mud settles and the water is clear?<br />
Can you remain unmoving<br />
till the right action arises by itself?<br />
The Master doesn’t seek fulfillment.<br />
Not seeking, not expecting,<br />
she is present, and can welcome all things.</p>
<h3>16 <a id="section-16"></a></h3>
<p>Empty your mind of all thoughts.<br />
Let your heart be at peace.<br />
Watch the turmoil of beings,<br />
but contemplate their return.<br />
Each separate being in the universe<br />
returns to the common source.<br />
Returning to the source is serenity.<br />
If you don’t realize the source,<br />
you stumble in confusion and sorrow.<br />
When you realize where you come from,<br />
you naturally become tolerant,<br />
disinterested, amused,<br />
kindhearted as a grandmother,<br />
dignified as a king.<br />
Immersed in the wonder of the Tao,<br />
you can deal with whatever life brings you,<br />
and when death comes, you are ready.</p>
<h3>17 <a id="section-17"></a></h3>
<p>When the Master governs, the people<br />
are hardly aware that he exists.<br />
Next best is a leader who is loved.<br />
Next, one who is feared.<br />
The worst is one who is despised.<br />
If you don’t trust the people,<br />
you make them untrustworthy.<br />
The Master doesn’t talk, he acts.<br />
When his work is done,<br />
the people say, &quot;Amazing: we did it, all by ourselves!&quot;</p>
<h3>18 <a id="section-18"></a></h3>
<p>When the great Tao is forgotten,<br />
goodness and piety appear.<br />
When the body’s intelligence declines,<br />
cleverness and knowledge step forth.<br />
When there is no peace in the family,<br />
filial piety begins.<br />
When the country falls into chaos,<br />
patriotism is born.</p>
<h3>19 <a id="section-19"></a></h3>
<p>Throw away holiness and wisdom,<br />
and people will be a hundred times happier.<br />
Throw away morality and justice,<br />
and people will do the right thing.<br />
Throw away industry and profit,<br />
and there won’t be any thieves.<br />
If these three aren’t enough,<br />
just stay at the center of the circle<br />
and let all things take their course.</p>
<h3>20 <a id="section-20"></a></h3>
<p>Stop thinking, and end your problems.<br />
What difference between yes and no?<br />
What difference between success and failure?<br />
Must you value what others value,<br />
avoid what others avoid?<br />
How ridiculous! Other people are excited,<br />
as though they were at a parade.<br />
I alone don’t care,<br />
I alone am expressionless,<br />
like an infant before it can smile.<br />
Other people have what they need;<br />
I alone possess nothing.<br />
I alone drift about,<br />
like someone without a home.<br />
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.<br />
Other people are bright;<br />
I alone am dark.<br />
Other people are sharper;<br />
I alone am dull.<br />
Other people have a purpose;<br />
I alone don’t know.<br />
I drift like a wave on the ocean,<br />
I blow as aimless as the wind.<br />
I am different from ordinary people.<br />
I drink from the Great Mother’s breasts.</p>
<h3>21 <a id="section-21"></a></h3>
<p>The Master keeps her mind<br />
always at one with the Tao;<br />
that is what gives her her radiance.<br />
The Tao is ungraspable.<br />
How can her mind be at one with it?<br />
Because she doesn’t cling to ideas.<br />
The Tao is dark and unfathomable.<br />
How can it make her radiant?<br />
Because she lets it.<br />
Since before time and space were, the Tao is.<br />
It is beyond is and is not.<br />
How do I know this is true?<br />
I look inside myself and see.</p>
<h3>22 <a id="section-22"></a></h3>
<p>If you want to become whole,<br />
let yourself be partial.<br />
If you want to become straight,<br />
let yourself be crooked.<br />
If you want to become full,<br />
let yourself be empty.<br />
If you want to be reborn,<br />
let yourself die.<br />
If you want to be given everything,<br />
give everything up.<br />
The Master, by residing in the Tao,<br />
sets an example for all beings.<br />
Because he doesn’t display himself,<br />
people can see his light.<br />
Because he has nothing to prove,<br />
people can trust his words.<br />
Because he doesn’t know who he is,<br />
people recognize themselves in him.<br />
Because he has no goad in mind,<br />
everything he does succeeds.<br />
When the ancient Masters said,<br />
&quot;If you want to be given everything, give everything up,&quot;<br />
they weren’t using empty phrases.<br />
Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.</p>
<h3>23 <a id="section-23"></a></h3>
<p>Express yourself completely,<br />
then keep quiet.<br />
Be like the forces of nature:<br />
when it blows, there is only wind;<br />
when it rains, there is only rain;<br />
when the clouds pass, the sun shines through.<br />
If you open yourself to the Tao,<br />
you are at one with the Tao<br />
and you can embody it completely.<br />
If you open yourself to insight,<br />
you are at one with insight<br />
and you can use it completely.<br />
If you open yourself to loss,<br />
you are at one with loss<br />
and you can accept it completely.<br />
Open yourself to the Tao,<br />
then trust your natural responses;<br />
and everything will fall into place.</p>
<h3>24 <a id="section-24"></a></h3>
<p>He who stands on tiptoe<br />
doesn’t stand firm.<br />
He who rushes ahead<br />
doesn’t go far.<br />
He who tries to shine<br />
dims his own light.<br />
He who defines himself<br />
can’t know who he really is.<br />
He who has power over others<br />
can’t empower himself.<br />
He who clings to his work<br />
will create nothing that endures.<br />
If you want to accord with the Tao,<br />
just do your job,<br />
then let go.</p>
<h3>25 <a id="section-25"></a></h3>
<p>There was something formless and perfect<br />
before the universe was born.<br />
It is serene. Empty.<br />
Solitary. Unchanging.<br />
Infinite. Eternally present.<br />
It is the mother of the universe.<br />
For lack of a better name,<br />
I call it the Tao.<br />
It flows through all things,<br />
inside and outside, and returns<br />
to the origin of all things.<br />
The Tao is great.<br />
The universe is great.<br />
Earth is great.<br />
Man is great.<br />
These are the four great powers.<br />
Man follows the earth.<br />
Earth follows the universe.<br />
The universe follows the Tao.<br />
The Tao follows only itself.</p>
<h3>26 <a id="section-26"></a></h3>
<p>The heavy is the root of the light.<br />
The unmoved is the source of all movement.<br />
Thus the Master travels all day<br />
without leaving home.<br />
However splendid the views,<br />
she stays serenely in herself.<br />
Why should the lord of the country<br />
flit about like a fool?<br />
If you let yourself be blown to and fro,<br />
you lose touch with your root.<br />
If you let restlessness move you,<br />
you lose touch with who you are.</p>
<h3>27 <a id="section-27"></a></h3>
<p>A good traveler has no fixed plans<br />
and is not intent upon arriving.<br />
A good artist lets his intuition<br />
lead him wherever it wants.<br />
A good scientist has freed himself of concepts<br />
and keeps his mind open to what is.<br />
Thus the Master is available to all people<br />
and doesn’t reject anyone.<br />
He is ready to use all situations<br />
and doesn’t waste anything.<br />
This is called embodying the light.<br />
What is a good man but a bad man’s teacher?<br />
What is a bad man but a good man’s job?<br />
If you don’t understand this,<br />
you will get lost,<br />
however intelligent you are.<br />
It is the great secret.</p>
<h3>28 <a id="section-28"></a></h3>
<p>Know the male,<br />
yet keep to the female:<br />
receive the world in your arms.<br />
If you receive the world,<br />
the Tao will never leave you<br />
and you will be like a little child.<br />
Know the white,<br />
yet keep to the black:<br />
be a pattern for the world.<br />
If you are a pattern for the world,<br />
the Tao will be strong inside you<br />
and there will be nothing you can’t do.<br />
Know the personal,<br />
yet keep to the impersonal:<br />
accept the world as it is.<br />
If you accept the world,<br />
the Tao will be luminous inside you<br />
and you will return to your primal self.<br />
The world is formed from the void,<br />
like utensils from a block of wood.<br />
The Master knows the utensils,<br />
yet keeps to the the block:<br />
thus she can use all things.</p>
<h3>29 <a id="section-29"></a></h3>
<p>Do you want to improve the world?<br />
I don’t think it can be done. The world is sacred.<br />
It can’t be improved.<br />
If you tamper with it, you’ll ruin it.<br />
If you treat it like an object, you’ll lose it.<br />
There is a time for being ahead,<br />
a time for being behind;<br />
a time for being in motion,<br />
a time for being at rest;<br />
a time for being vigorous,<br />
a time for being exhausted;<br />
a time for being safe,<br />
a time for being in danger.<br />
The Master sees things as they are,<br />
without trying to control them.<br />
She lets them go their own way,<br />
and resides at the center of the circle.</p>
<h3>30 <a id="section-30"></a></h3>
<p>Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men<br />
doesn’t try to force issues<br />
or defeat enemies by force of arms.<br />
For every force there is a counterforce.<br />
Violence, even well intentioned,<br />
always rebounds upon oneself.<br />
The Master does his job<br />
and then stops.<br />
He understands that the universe<br />
is forever out of control,<br />
and that trying to dominate events<br />
goes against the current of the Tao.<br />
Because he believes in himself,<br />
he doesn’t try to convince others.<br />
Because he is content with himself,<br />
he doesn’t need others’ approval.<br />
Because he accepts himself,<br />
the whole world accepts him.</p>
<h3>31 <a id="section-31"></a></h3>
<p>Weapons are the tools of violence;<br />
all decent men detest them.<br />
Weapons are the tools of fear;<br />
a decent man will avoid them<br />
except in the direst necessity<br />
and, if compelled, will use them<br />
only with the utmost restraint.<br />
Peace is his highest value.<br />
If the peace has been shattered,<br />
how can he be content?<br />
His enemies are not demons,<br />
but human beings like himself.<br />
He doesn’t wish them personal harm.<br />
Nor does he rejoice in victory.<br />
How could he rejoice in victory<br />
and delight in the slaughter of men?<br />
He enters a battle gravely,<br />
with sorrow and with great compassion,<br />
as if he were attending a funeral.</p>
<h3>32 <a id="section-32"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao can’t be perceived.<br />
Smaller than an electron,<br />
it contains uncountable galaxies.<br />
If powerful men and women<br />
could remain centered in the Tao,<br />
all things would be in harmony.<br />
The world would become a paradise.<br />
All people would be at peace,<br />
and the law would be written in their hearts.<br />
When you have names and forms,<br />
know that they are provisional.<br />
When you have institutions,<br />
know where their functions should end.<br />
Knowing when to stop,<br />
you can avoid any danger.<br />
All things end in the Tao<br />
as rivers flow into the sea.</p>
<h3>33 <a id="section-33"></a></h3>
<p>Knowing others is intelligence;<br />
knowing yourself is true wisdom.<br />
Mastering others is strength;<br />
mastering yourself is true power.<br />
If you realize that you have enough,<br />
you are truly rich.<br />
If you stay in the center<br />
and embrace death with your whole heart,<br />
you will endure forever.</p>
<h3>34 <a id="section-34"></a></h3>
<p>The great Tao flows everywhere.<br />
All things are born from it,<br />
yet it doesn’t create them.<br />
It pours itself into its work,<br />
yet it makes no claim.<br />
It nourishes infinite worlds,<br />
yet it doesn’t hold on to them.<br />
Since it is merged with all things<br />
and hidden in their hearts,<br />
it can be called humble.<br />
Since all things vanish into it<br />
and it alone endures,<br />
it can be called great.<br />
It isn’t aware of its greatness;<br />
thus it is truly great.</p>
<h3>35 <a id="section-35"></a></h3>
<p>She who is centered in the Tao<br />
can go where she wishes, without danger.<br />
She perceives the universal harmony,<br />
even amid great pain,<br />
because she has found peace in her heart.<br />
Music or the smell of good cooking<br />
may make people stop and enjoy.<br />
But words that point to the Tao<br />
seem monotonous and without flavor.<br />
When you look for it, there is nothing to see.<br />
When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear.<br />
When you use it, it is inexhaustible.</p>
<h3>36 <a id="section-36"></a></h3>
<p>If you want to shrink something,<br />
you must first allow it to expand.<br />
If you want to get rid of something,<br />
you must first allow it to flourish.<br />
If you want to take something,<br />
you must first allow it to be given.<br />
This is called the subtle perception<br />
of the way things are.<br />
The soft overcomes the hard.<br />
The slow overcomes the fast.<br />
Let your workings remain a mystery.<br />
Just show people the results.</p>
<h3>37 <a id="section-37"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao never does anything,<br />
yet through it all things are done.<br />
If powerful men and women<br />
could venter themselves in it,<br />
the whole world would be transformed<br />
by itself, in its natural rhythms.<br />
People would be content<br />
with their simple, everyday lives,<br />
in harmony, and free of desire.<br />
When there is no desire,<br />
all things are at peace.</p>
<h2>Book Two</h2>
<h3>38 <a id="section-38"></a></h3>
<p>The Master doesn’t try to be powerful;<br />
thus he is truly powerful.<br />
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;<br />
thus he never has enough.<br />
The Master does nothing,<br />
yet he leaves nothing undone.<br />
The ordinary man is always doing things,<br />
yet many more are left to be done.<br />
The kind man does something,<br />
yet something remains undone.<br />
The just man does something,<br />
and leaves many things to be done.<br />
The moral man does something,<br />
and when no one responds<br />
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.<br />
When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.<br />
When goodness is lost, there is morality.<br />
When morality is lost, there is ritual.<br />
Ritual is the husk of true faith,<br />
the beginning of chaos.<br />
Therefore the Master concerns himself<br />
with the depths and not the surface,<br />
with the fruit and not the flower.<br />
He has no will of his own.<br />
He dwells in reality,<br />
and lets all illusions go.</p>
<h3>39 <a id="section-39"></a></h3>
<p>In harmony with the Tao,<br />
the sky is clear and spacious,<br />
the earth is solid and full,<br />
all creature flourish together,<br />
content with the way they are,<br />
endlessly repeating themselves,<br />
endlessly renewed.<br />
When man interferes with the Tao,<br />
the sky becomes filthy,<br />
the earth becomes depleted,<br />
the equilibrium crumbles,<br />
creatures become extinct.<br />
The Master views the parts with compassion,<br />
because he understands the whole.<br />
His constant practice is humility.<br />
He doesn’t glitter like a jewel<br />
but lets himself be shaped by the Tao,<br />
as rugged and common as stone.</p>
<h3>40 <a id="section-40"></a></h3>
<p>Return is the movement of the Tao.<br />
Yielding is the way of the Tao.<br />
All things are born of being.<br />
Being is born of non-being.<br /></p>
<h3>41 <a id="section-41"></a></h3>
<p>When a superior man hears of the Tao,<br />
he immediately begins to embody it.<br />
When an average man hears of the Tao,<br />
he half believes it, half doubts it.<br />
When a foolish man hears of the Tao,<br />
he laughs out loud.<br />
If he didn’t laugh,<br />
it wouldn’t be the Tao. Thus it is said:<br />
The path into the light seems dark,<br />
the path forward seems to go back,<br />
the direct path seems long,<br />
true power seems weak,<br />
true purity seems tarnished,<br />
true steadfastness seems changeable,<br />
true clarity seems obscure,<br />
the greatest are seems unsophisticated,<br />
the greatest love seems indifferent,<br />
the greatest wisdom seems childish.<br />
The Tao is nowhere to be found.<br />
Yet it nourishes and completes all things.</p>
<h3>42 <a id="section-42"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao gives birth to One.<br />
One gives birth to Two.<br />
Two gives birth to Three.<br />
Three gives birth to all things.<br />
All things have their backs to the female<br />
and stand facing the male.<br />
When male and female combine,<br />
all things achieve harmony.<br />
Ordinary men hate solitude.<br />
But the Master makes use of it,<br />
embracing his aloneness,<br />
realizing he is one with the whole universe.</p>
<h3>43 <a id="section-43"></a></h3>
<p>The gentlest thing in the world<br />
overcomes the hardest thing in the world.<br />
That which has no substance<br />
enters where there is no space.<br />
This shows the value of non-action.<br />
Teaching without words,<br />
performing without actions:<br />
that is the Master’s way.</p>
<h3>44 <a id="section-44"></a></h3>
<p>Fame or integrity: which is more important?<br />
Money or happiness: which is more valuable?<br />
Success of failure: which is more destructive?<br />
If you look to others for fulfillment,<br />
you will never truly be fulfilled.<br />
If your happiness depends on money,<br />
you will never be happy with yourself.<br />
Be content with what you have;<br />
rejoice in the way things are.<br />
When you realize there is nothing lacking,<br />
the whole world belongs to you.</p>
<h3>45 <a id="section-45"></a></h3>
<p>True perfection seems imperfect,<br />
yet it is perfectly itself.<br />
True fullness seems empty,<br />
yet it is fully present.<br />
True straightness seems crooked.<br />
True wisdom seems foolish.<br />
True art seems artless.<br />
The Master allows things to happen.<br />
She shapes events as they come.<br />
She steps out of the way<br />
and lets the Tao speak for itself.</p>
<h3>46 <a id="section-46"></a></h3>
<p>When a country is in harmony with the Tao,<br />
the factories make trucks and tractors.<br />
When a country goes counter to the Tao,<br />
warheads are stockpiled outside the cities.<br />
There is no greater illusion than fear,<br />
no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself,<br />
no greater misfortune than having an enemy.<br />
Whoever can see through all fear<br />
will always be safe.</p>
<h3>47 <a id="section-47"></a></h3>
<p>Without opening your door,<br />
you can open your heart to the world.<br />
Without looking out your window,<br />
you can see the essence of the Tao.<br />
The more you know,<br />
the less you understand.<br />
The Master arrives without leaving,<br />
sees the light without looking,<br />
achieves without doing a thing.</p>
<h3>48 <a id="section-48"></a></h3>
<p>In pursuit of knowledge,<br />
every day something is added.<br />
In the practice of the Tao,<br />
every day something is dropped.<br />
Less and less do you need to force things,<br />
until finally you arrive at non-action.<br />
When nothing is done,<br />
nothing is left undone.<br />
True mastery can be gained<br />
by letting things go their own way.<br />
It can’t be gained by interfering.</p>
<h3>49 <a id="section-49"></a></h3>
<p>The Master has no mind of her own.<br />
She works with the mind of the people.<br />
She is good to people who are good.<br />
She is also good to people who aren’t good.<br />
This is true goodness.<br />
She trusts people who are trustworthy.<br />
She also trusts people who aren’t trustworthy.<br />
This is true trust.<br />
The Master’s mind is like space.<br />
People don’t understand her.<br />
They look to her and wait.<br />
She treats them like her own children.</p>
<h3>50 <a id="section-50"></a></h3>
<p>The Master gives himself up<br />
to whatever the moment brings.<br />
He knows that he is going to die,<br />
and her has nothing left to hold on to:<br />
no illusions in his mind,<br />
no resistances in his body.<br />
He doesn’t think about his actions;<br />
they flow from the core of his being.<br />
He holds nothing back from life;<br />
therefore he is ready for death,<br />
as a man is ready for sleep<br />
after a good day’s work.</p>
<h3>51 <a id="section-51"></a></h3>
<p>Every being in the universe<br />
is an expression of the Tao.<br />
It springs into existence,<br />
unconscious, perfect, free,<br />
takes on a physical body,<br />
lets circumstances complete it.<br />
That is why every being<br />
spontaneously honors the Tao.<br />
The Tao gives birth to all beings,<br />
nourishes them, maintains them,<br />
cares for them, comforts them,<br />
protects them, takes them back to itself,<br />
creating without possessing,<br />
acting without expecting,<br />
guiding without interfering.<br />
That is why love of the Tao<br />
is in the very nature of things.</p>
<h3>52 <a id="section-52"></a></h3>
<p>In the beginning was the Tao.<br />
All things issue from it;<br />
all things return to it.<br />
To find the origin,<br />
trace back the manifestations.<br />
When you recognize the children<br />
and find the mother,<br />
you will be free of sorrow.<br />
If you close your mind in judgements<br />
and traffic with desires,<br />
your heart will be troubled.<br />
If you keep your mind from judging<br />
and aren’t led by the senses,<br />
your heart will find peace.<br />
Seeing into darkness is clarity.<br />
Knowing how to yield is strength.<br />
Use your own light<br />
and return to the source of light.<br />
This is called practicing eternity.</p>
<h3>53 <a id="section-53"></a></h3>
<p>The great Way is easy,<br />
yet people prefer the side paths.<br />
Be aware when things are out of balance.<br />
Stay centered within the Tao.<br />
When rich speculators prosper<br />
While farmers lose their land;<br />
when government officials spend money<br />
on weapons instead of cures;<br />
when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible<br />
while the poor have nowhere to turn-<br />
all this is robbery and chaos.<br />
It is not in keeping with the Tao.</p>
<h3>54 <a id="section-54"></a></h3>
<p>Whoever is planted in the Tao<br />
will not be rooted up.<br />
Whoever embraces the Tao<br />
will not slip away.<br />
Her name will be held in honor<br />
from generation to generation.<br />
Let the Tao be present in your life<br />
and you will become genuine.<br />
Let it be present in your family<br />
and your family will flourish.<br />
Let it be present in your country<br />
and your country will be an example<br />
to all countries in the world.<br />
Let it be present in the universe<br />
and the universe will sing.<br />
How do I know this is true?<br />
By looking inside myself.</p>
<h3>55 <a id="section-55"></a></h3>
<p>He who is in harmony with the Tao<br />
is like a newborn child.<br />
Its bones are soft, its muscles are weak,<br />
but its grip is powerful.<br />
It doesn’t know about the union<br />
of male and female,<br />
yet its penis can stand erect,<br />
so intense is its vital power.<br />
It can scream its head off all day,<br />
yet it never becomes hoarse,<br />
so complete is its harmony.<br />
The Master’s power is like this.<br />
He lets all things come and go effortlessly,<br />
without desire.<br />
He never expects results;<br />
thus he is never disappointed.<br />
He is never disappointed;<br />
thus his spirit never grows old.</p>
<h3>56 <a id="section-56"></a></h3>
<p>Those who know don’t talk.<br />
Those who talk don’t know.<br />
Close your mouth,<br />
block off your senses,<br />
blunt your sharpness,<br />
untie your knots,<br />
soften your glare,<br />
settle your dust.<br />
This is the primal identity.<br />
Be like the Tao.<br />
It can’t be approached or withdrawn from,<br />
benefited or harmed,<br />
honored or brought into disgrace.<br />
It gives itself up continually.<br />
That is why it endures.</p>
<h3>57 <a id="section-57"></a></h3>
<p>If you want to be a great leader,<br />
you must learn to follow the Tao.<br />
Stop trying to control.<br />
Let go of fixed plans and concepts,<br />
and the world will govern itself.<br />
The more prohibitions you have,<br />
the less virtuous people will be.<br />
The more weapons you have,<br />
the less secure people will be.<br />
The more subsidies you have,<br />
the less self-reliant people will be.<br />
Therefore the Master says:<br />
I let go of the law,<br />
and people become honest.<br />
I let go of economics,<br />
and people become prosperous.<br />
I let go of religion,<br />
and people become serene.<br />
I let go of all desire for the common good,<br />
and the good becomes common as grass.</p>
<h3>58 <a id="section-58"></a></h3>
<p>If a country is governed with tolerance,<br />
the people are comfortable and honest.<br />
If a country is governed with repression,<br />
the people are depressed and crafty.<br />
When the will to power is in charge,<br />
the higher the ideals, the lower the results.<br />
Try to make people happy,<br />
and you lay the groundwork for misery.<br />
Try to make people moral,<br />
and you lay the groundwork for vice.<br />
Thus the Master is content<br />
to serve as an example<br />
and not to impose her will.<br />
She is pointed, but doesn’t pierce.<br />
Straightforward, but supple.<br />
Radiant, but easy on the eyes.</p>
<h3>59 <a id="section-59"></a></h3>
<p>For governing a country well<br />
there is nothing better than moderation.<br />
The mark of a moderate man<br />
is freedom from his own ideas.<br />
Tolerant like the sky,<br />
all-pervading like sunlight,<br />
firm like a mountain,<br />
supple like a tree in the wind,<br />
he has no destination in view<br />
and makes use of anything<br />
life happens to bring his way.<br />
Nothing is impossible for him.<br />
Because he has let go,<br />
he can care for the people’s welfare<br />
as a mother cares for her child.</p>
<h3>60 <a id="section-60"></a></h3>
<p>Governing a large country<br />
is like frying a small fish.<br />
You spoil it with too much poking.<br />
Center your country in the Tao<br />
and evil will have no power.<br />
Not that it isn’t there,<br />
but you’ll be able to step out of its way.<br />
Give evil nothing to oppose<br />
and it will disappear by itself.</p>
<h3>61 <a id="section-61"></a></h3>
<p>When a country obtains great power,<br />
it becomes like the sea:<br />
all streams run downward into it.<br />
The more powerful it grows,<br />
the greater the need for humility.<br />
Humility means trusting the Tao,<br />
thus never needing to be defensive.<br />
A great nation is like a great man:<br />
When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.<br />
Having realized it, he admits it.<br />
Having admitted it, he corrects it.<br />
He considers those who point out his faults<br />
as his most benevolent teachers.<br />
He thinks of his enemy<br />
as the shadow that he himself casts.<br />
If a nation is centered in the Tao,<br />
if it nourishes its own people<br />
and doesn’t meddle in the affairs of others,<br />
it will be a light to all nations in the world.</p>
<h3>62 <a id="section-62"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao is the center of the universe,<br />
the good man’s treasure,<br />
the bad man’s refuge.<br />
Honors can be bought with fine words,<br />
respect can be won with good deeds;<br />
but the Tao is beyond all value,<br />
and no one can achieve it.<br />
Thus, when a new leader is chosen,<br />
don’t offer to help him<br />
with your wealth or your expertise.<br />
Offer instead<br />
to teach him about the Tao.<br />
Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao?<br />
Because, being one with the Tao,<br />
when you seek, you find;<br />
and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven.<br />
That is why everybody loves it.</p>
<h3>63 <a id="section-63"></a></h3>
<p>Act without doing;<br />
work without effort.<br />
Think of the small as large<br />
and the few as many.<br />
Confront the difficult<br />
while it is still easy;<br />
accomplish the great task<br />
by a series of small acts.<br />
The Master never reaches for the great;<br />
thus she achieves greatness.<br />
When she runs into a difficulty,<br />
she stops and gives herself to it.<br />
She doesn’t cling to her own comfort;<br />
thus problems are no problem for her.</p>
<h3>64 <a id="section-64"></a></h3>
<p>What is rooted is easy to nourish.<br />
What is recent is easy to correct.<br />
What is brittle is easy to break.<br />
What is small is easy to scatter.<br />
Prevent trouble before it arises.<br />
Put things in order before they exist.<br />
The giant pine tree<br />
grows from a tiny sprout.<br />
The journey of a thousand miles<br />
starts from beneath your feet.<br />
Rushing into action, you fail.<br />
Trying to grasp things, you lose them.<br />
Forcing a project to completion,<br />
you ruin what was almost ripe.<br />
Therefore the Master takes action<br />
by letting things take their course.<br />
He remains as calm<br />
at the end as at the beginning.<br />
He has nothing,<br />
thus has nothing to lose.<br />
What he desires is non-desire;<br />
what he learns is to unlearn.<br />
He simply reminds people<br />
of who they have always been.<br />
He cares about nothing but the Tao.<br />
Thus he can care for all things.</p>
<h3>65 <a id="section-65"></a></h3>
<p>The ancient Masters<br />
didn’t try to educate the people,<br />
but kindly taught them to not-know.<br />
When they think that they know the answers,<br />
people are difficult to guide.<br />
When they know that they don’t know,<br />
people can find their own way.<br />
If you want to learn how to govern,<br />
avoid being clever or rich.<br />
The simplest pattern is the clearest.<br />
Content with an ordinary life,<br />
you can show all people the way<br />
back to their own true nature.</p>
<h3>66 <a id="section-66"></a></h3>
<p>All streams flow to the sea<br />
because it is lower than they are.<br />
Humility gives it its power.<br />
If you want to govern the people,<br />
you must place yourself below them.<br />
If you want to lead the people,<br />
you must learn how to follow them.<br />
The Master is above the people,<br />
and no one feels oppressed.<br />
She goes ahead of the people,<br />
and no one feels manipulated.<br />
The whole world is grateful to her.<br />
Because she competes with no one,<br />
no one can compete with her.</p>
<h3>67 <a id="section-67"></a></h3>
<p>Some say that my teaching is nonsense.<br />
Others call it lofty but impractical.<br />
But to those who have looked inside themselves,<br />
this nonsense makes perfect sense.<br />
And to those who put it into practice,<br />
this loftiness has roots that go deep.<br />
I have just three things to teach:<br />
simplicity, patience, compassion.<br />
These three are your greatest treasures.<br />
Simple in actions and in thoughts,<br />
you return to the source of being.<br />
Patient with both friends and enemies,<br />
you accord with the way things are.<br />
Compassionate toward yourself,<br />
you reconcile all beings in the world.</p>
<h3>68 <a id="section-68"></a></h3>
<p>The best athlete<br />
wants his opponent at his best.<br />
The best general<br />
enters the mind of his enemy.<br />
The best businessman<br />
serves the communal good.<br />
The best leader<br />
follows the will of the people.<br />
All of the embody<br />
the virtue of non-competition.<br />
Not that they don’t love to compete,<br />
but they do it in the spirit of play.<br />
In this they are like children<br />
and in harmony with the Tao.</p>
<h3>69 <a id="section-69"></a></h3>
<p>The generals have a saying:<br />
&quot;Rather than make the first move<br />
it is better to wait and see.<br />
Rather than advance an inch<br />
it is better to retreat a yard.&quot;<br />
This is called going forward without advancing,<br />
pushing back without using weapons.<br />
There is no greater misfortune<br />
than underestimating your enemy.<br />
Underestimating your enemy<br />
means thinking that he is evil.<br />
Thus you destroy your three treasures<br />
and become an enemy yourself.<br />
When two great forces oppose each other,<br />
the victory will go<br />
to the one that knows how to yield.</p>
<h3>70 <a id="section-70"></a></h3>
<p>My teachings are easy to understand<br />
and easy to put into practice.<br />
Yet your intellect will never grasp them,<br />
and if you try to practice them, you’ll fail.<br />
My teachings are older than the world.<br />
How can you grasp their meaning?<br />
If you want to know me,<br />
look inside your heart.</p>
<h3>71 <a id="section-71"></a></h3>
<p>Not-knowing is true knowledge.<br />
Presuming to know is a disease.<br />
First realize that you are sick;<br />
then you can move toward health.<br />
The Master is her own physician.<br />
She has healed herself of all knowing.<br />
Thus she is truly whole.</p>
<h3>72 <a id="section-72"></a></h3>
<p>When they lose their sense of awe,<br />
people turn to religion.<br />
When they no longer trust themselves,<br />
they begin to depend upon authority.<br />
Therefore the Master steps back<br />
so that people won’t be confused.<br />
He teaches without a teaching,<br />
so that people will have nothing to learn.</p>
<h3>73 <a id="section-73"></a></h3>
<p>The Tao is always at ease.<br />
It overcomes without competing,<br />
answers without speaking a word,<br />
arrives without being summoned,<br />
accomplishes without a plan.<br />
Its net covers the whole universe.<br />
And though its meshes are wide,<br />
it doesn’t let a thing slip through.</p>
<h3>74 <a id="section-74"></a></h3>
<p>If you realize that all things change,<br />
there is nothing you will try to hold on to.<br />
If you aren’t afraid of dying,<br />
there is nothing you can’t achieve.<br />
Trying to control the future<br />
is like trying to take the master carpenter’s place.<br />
When you handle the master carpenter’s tools,<br />
chances are that you’ll cut your hand.</p>
<h3>75 <a id="section-75"></a></h3>
<p>When taxes are too high,<br />
people go hungry.<br />
When the government is too intrusive,<br />
people lose their spirit.<br />
Act for the people’s benefit.<br />
Trust them; leave them alone.</p>
<h3>76 <a id="section-76"></a></h3>
<p>Men are born soft and supple;<br />
dead, they are stiff and hard.<br />
Plats are born tender and pliant;<br />
dead, they are brittle and dry.<br />
Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible<br />
is a disciple of death.<br />
Whoever is soft and yielding<br />
is a disciple of life.<br />
The hard and stiff will be broken.<br />
The soft and supple will prevail.</p>
<h3>77 <a id="section-77"></a></h3>
<p>As it acts in the world, the Tao<br />
is like the bending of a bow.<br />
The top is bent downward;<br />
the bottom is bent up.<br />
It adjusts excess and deficiency<br />
so that there is perfect balance.<br />
It takes from what is too much<br />
and give to what isn’t enough.<br />
Those who try to control,<br />
who use force to protect their power,<br />
go against the direction of the Tao.<br />
They take from those who don’t have enough<br />
and give to those who have far too much.<br />
The Master can keep giving<br />
because there is no end to her wealth.<br />
She acts without expectation,<br />
succeeds without taking credit,<br />
and doesn’t think that she is better<br />
than anyone else.</p>
<h3>78 <a id="section-78"></a></h3>
<p>Nothing in the world<br />
is as soft and yielding as water.<br />
Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,<br />
nothing can surpass it.<br />
The soft overcomes the hard;<br />
the gentle overcomes the rigid.<br />
Everyone knows this is true,<br />
but few can put it into practice.<br />
Therefore the Master remains<br />
serene in the midst of sorrow.<br />
Evil cannot enter his heart.<br />
Because he has given up helping,<br />
he is people’s greatest help.<br />
True words seem paradoxical.</p>
<h3>79 <a id="section-79"></a></h3>
<p>Failure is an opportunity.<br />
If you blame someone else,<br />
there is no end to the blame.<br />
Therefore the Master<br />
fulfills her own obligations<br />
and corrects her own mistakes.<br />
She does what she needs to do<br />
and demands nothing of others.</p>
<h3>80 <a id="section-80"></a></h3>
<p>If a country is governed wisely,<br />
its inhabitants will be content.<br />
They enjoy the labor of their hands<br />
and don’t waste time inventing<br />
labor-saving machines.<br />
Since they dearly love their homes,<br />
they aren’t interested in travel.<br />
There may be a few wagons and boats,<br />
but these don’t go anywhere.<br />
There may be an arsenal of weapons,<br />
but nobody ever uses them.<br />
People enjoy their food,<br />
take pleasure in being with their families,<br />
spend weekends working in their gardens,<br />
delight in the doings of the neighborhood.<br />
And even though the next country is so close<br />
that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking,<br />
they are content to die of old age<br />
without ever having gone to see it.</p>
<h3>81 <a id="section-81"></a></h3>
<p>True words aren’t eloquent;<br />
eloquent words aren’t true.<br />
Wise men don’t need to prove their point;<br />
men who need to prove their point aren’t wise.<br />
The Master has no possessions.<br />
The more he does for others,<br />
the happier he is.<br />
The more he gives to others,<br />
the wealthier he is.<br />
The Tao nourishes by not forcing.<br />
By not dominating, the Master leads.</p>
